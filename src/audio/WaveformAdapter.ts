/**
 * WaveformAdapter Module - DEPRECATED
 * 
 * This file has been replaced by CustomWaveform.ts which uses native Web Audio API
 * instead of WaveSurfer.js library.
 * 
 * Reason for replacement:
 * - WaveSurfer.js caused ACCESS_VIOLATION crashes due to parallel audio decoding
 * - CustomWaveform uses single audio decode path with Canvas rendering
 * - Lighter weight (no external dependency)
 * - Better performance and stability
 * 
 * @deprecated Use CustomWaveform from './CustomWaveform' instead
